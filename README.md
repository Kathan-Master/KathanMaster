AI-Powered Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! This project showcases my journey and achievements, leveraging the power of AI and automation to keep content fresh and interactive.

🚀 Key Features
1. automated Content Updates
I have implemented a fully automated pipeline using Python and GitHub Actions.

Daily Updates: My portfolio automatically updates every day at 12:00 UTC.

Dynamic Content: The system fetches and features my latest videos, covering topics ranging from technical projects to travel vlogs.

2. Custom Contact Form (Telegram API)
To keep communication efficient and cost-effective, I built a custom contact solution using the Telegram API.

Direct Messaging: Messages sent through the website are routed directly to my Telegram bot.

Serverless Architecture: This cloud-based approach allows for real-time communication without the overhead of traditional backend servers.

⚠️ Important Technical Note: Because the contact form runs on a serverless/cloud architecture, the bot may enter a "sleep mode" if it hasn't been used recently.

If your message doesn't send immediately: Please wait a moment and try again.

Second Attempt: Once the instance wakes up, subsequent messages will be delivered instantly.
